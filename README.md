## About
"Youlag Theme for [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/)" provides a video-focused browsing experience for your RSS subscriptions.

This opinionated theme is best for video feeds but may still work with regular content. Set up a separate FreshRSS instance if needed.

## Features

- ‚≠ê **Video Browsing & Viewing**
  - Familiar video platform layout.
  - View feed items in fullscreen "theater view".
  - Auto-stops video when closing (prevents background play in FreshRSS).
  - Dark mode.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Optimized for Desktop & Mobile**
  - Redesigned menus for better mobile usability.
  - Improved legibility.
- üì∫ **FreshRSS features:**
  - Subscribe to YouTube creators without an account.

### Planned
- Minimize video, to allow background playback while browsing feed.
- Local video queue (without autoplay, due to CORS limitation).
- Major refactoring to improve stability and browser compatability.
