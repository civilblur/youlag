## About
Youlag delivers a video-focused browsing experience for your YouTube RSS feeds in FreshRSS, with a sleek theme and extra features.

While it also supports regular feeds, this setup is tailored specifically for video content. Feel free and set up a separate instance for your video feeds if needed.

## Features

- ‚≠ê **Optimized for Video Viewing**
  - Browse your YouTube, Invidious, Piped RSS subscriptions with ease.
  - Clean, familiar video platform layout.
  - Fullscreen viewing for videos and feed items.
  - Quickly exit videos with `Esc` key.
  - Shortcuts for external viewing: "Invidious", "YouTube", or "YouTube embed view" (for less distraction).
  - Dark mode.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop & Mobile**
  - Reponsive design.
  - Redesigned menus for better one-handed navigation.
  - Improved readability and legibility across devices.
- üì∫ **FreshRSS features:**
  - Subscribe to YouTube creators without an account.

### Planned
- Minimize video, for background playback while browsing.
- Local video queue, but without autoplay due to CORS limitation.
- Clickable links in video descriptions.
- Convert to an actual FreshRSS extension, with options for customizing the view and features.
  - Ability to specify which category to apply the video grid on, with the intention to only affect video feeds.

## Install

1. Go to `Settings > Configuration: Display` and use these settings:
   - **Theme**: "Mapco ‚Äî By: Thomas Guesnon".

1. Go to `Settings > Extensions` and click the gear (‚öôÔ∏è) icon for each extension:
   - **User JS**: Copy the content from `script.js` paste it into the text field, and click "Submit".
   - **User CSS**: Copy the content from `theme.css`, paste it into the text field, and click "Submit".
   - User JS and User CSS extensions now come with FreshRSS by default. If missing, get them from the [official extensions repository](https://github.com/FreshRSS/Extensions). 

1. Enable the extensions.
