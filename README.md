## About
"Youlag: Theme and Video Extension for [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/)" provides a video-focused browsing experience for your RSS subscriptions.

This opinionated theme and extension is best for video feeds but may still work with regular content. Feel free and set up a separate FreshRSS instance if needed.

## Features

- ‚≠ê **Optimized for Video Viewing**
  - Browse your YouTube RSS subscriptions with ease.
  - Clean, familiar video platform layout.
  - Fullscreen viewing for videos and feed items.
  - Quickly exit videos with `Esc` key.
  - Shortcuts for external viewing: "YouTube Website", or "YouTube Embed" for distraction-free playback.
  - Dark mode.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop & Mobile**
  - Reponsive design.
  - Redesigned menus for better one-handed navigation.
  - Improved readability and legibility across devices.

### Planned
- Minimize video, for background playback while browsing.
- Local video queue, but without autoplay due to CORS limitation.
