## About
Youlag delivers a video-focused browsing experience for your YouTube RSS feeds in FreshRSS, with a sleek theme and extra features.

While it also supports regular feeds, this setup is tailored specifically for video content. Feel free and set up a separate instance for your video feeds if needed.

## Features

- ‚≠ê **Optimized for Video Viewing**
  - Browse your YouTube or Invidious RSS subscriptions with ease.
  - Clean, familiar video platform layout.
  - Fullscreen viewing for videos and feed items.
  - Quickly exit videos with `Esc` key.
  - Shortcuts for external viewing: "Invidious", "YouTube", or "YouTube embed view" (for less distraction).
  - Dark mode.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop & Mobile**
  - Reponsive design.
  - Redesigned menus for better one-handed navigation.
  - Improved readability and legibility across devices.
- üì∫ **FreshRSS features:**
  - Subscribe to YouTube creators without an account.

### Planned
- Minimize video, for background playback while browsing.
- Local video queue, but without autoplay due to CORS limitation.
- Clickable links in video descriptions.
- Convert to an actual FreshRSS extension, with options for customizing the view and features.

   - **Theme**: "Mapco ‚Äî By: Thomas Guesnon".
